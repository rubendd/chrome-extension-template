# Web-Template - TypeScript and Bun Extension Template


## Overview

Template for developing browser extensions using TypeScript and Bun, a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime. This template streamlines the setup process for your extension development, allowing you to focus on building features rather than dealing with configuration.

## Getting Started

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To build the extension:

```bash
bun build
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.18. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
